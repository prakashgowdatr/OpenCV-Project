# 🚦 Traffic Sign Classification with GUI

This project is a **Traffic Sign Classification System** built using **Python**. It includes a trained deep learning model for recognizing Indian traffic signs and a **Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI)** for user interaction. The project allows users to upload images of traffic signs and receive the corresponding prediction label.

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras pillow numpy opencv-python
```

How to Run
Clone the repository or download the files

Ensure gui.py and traffic_sign.py are in the same directory

Run the GUI app:
```bash
python gui.py
```

Model Info
The model is trained on a traffic signs dataset.

Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.

The model and class label mappings are defined in traffic_sign.py.
